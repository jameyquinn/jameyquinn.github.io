## tl;dr:

Here's how I introduce myself to companies (see [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamesequinn/))


> Having engineered and architected big-scale applications, built effective teams, and led research in the U.S., Kenya, Egypt, Thailand, Lebanon, India, Tunisia, Kyrgyzstan, Libya, Uzbekistan, and the Netherlands, I advise and implement data strategies ...

But, this hardly captures everything I am. Every day I learn how to better listen, learn, and express myself. Today, for example, I played guitar instead of eating lunch. I regularly read a chapter of something fascinating before beginning my day (today: *The Tangled Tree*, David Quammen 2018.) I steal moments to play where my 2 children and I wrestle and make up stories. Every night - as my colleagues have noticed on some late calls - my partner and I read and sing to/with our lovelies.

My partner is often frustrated that I would rather build something (and have it later) than buy something (and have it now-ish). My colleagues are often frustrated that I am inconsistent between home and work.

Like a good tall tree, I require sunshine, a fresh breeze, the buzz of life around me, and water to feel happy.

I have an experimental approach ("scouting" - searching for what's real) to most things. I am willing to be the proverbial guinea pig for a crazy idea. If you're playing music I might be the first to dance simply to give others the nerve and the freedom to dance themselves silly. Other times, I'll be the last one up, while I sit back and applaud, knowing that every person should have a chance to shine without shadows cast on them.

## My job

As an engineer, architect, and leader, I expect myself to...

* Set context and communicate expected business outcomes
* Understand and - where possible - influence priorities
* Foster learning and personal growth through experience
* Ensure that decisions are made via consultations with relevant stakeholders
* Build space for free expression and fearless exploration of ideas - protecting the creative process
* Aggregating visions, translating these into specific requirements ... basically human centered *map-reduce*
* Embrace confusion while striving to minimize it

## Baseline principles

In day to day life, I use a few principles that I rely on when - I will admit it - I don't know what to do.

* Exemplify empathy
* Represent others more positively than they would represent themselves
* Integrity and candour are **not** up for debate
* You are what you practice, repeatedly (thank you for this gem @colin.steele)
* I expect excellence from **myself** and then from others, I support other's opinion at all times even in disagreement. Along the way, I make mistakes. I take accountability and learn from these.

## My management style

A former colleague described my management style as "transformational" ["getting everyone to contribute to the big picture" was how he put it].  A current colleague used "visionary" [his words: "innovative and inspiring"] to describe my approach. There are subtle distinctions between these, but I think context of leadership can drive the style more than innate preference. I don't disagree with these, but I don't particularly like the labels because of the judgment they imply. "Transformational" does not capture that I challenge a lot of things in people - sometimes even their patience. I do challenge assumptions, and intent, and process because I am more confident in the people around me when I see that they too have thought about the context we operate in.

Bullet points are admittedly trite, so here are some quick phrases that I repeat to myself when managing:

* kindness before rightness
* those who "do" get to "decide"
* don't tell me, show me
* if you want to lead, then start walking
* management â‰  (does NOT equal) leadership.

### To my reports: I serve you

To actually help you, I only need that you tell me what *you* need. Sometimes, all you'll need is a rubber-duck (someone to bounce an idea on). Other times, you'll need a champion - where I'll help clear a path. Sometimes, you'll need reminder of what we're doing on this lump of rock and water hurtling through the cosmos - I will do my best to reflect on how much we've done together and how much we have yet to do.

If in doubt, start like this: "Jamey, I need...." The rest we'll figure out.

### The case for *Time and Space*
The communication patterns of individuals and teams need time to develop and can be disrupted if not left alone to grow. I build space and time for the communication channels to grow and deepen. Trust is another growable thing. I've been on the teams that stand up the first day where we all say "trust is the most important thing!" Yes, but it's not automatic and it's not even that regularly attained - certainly not by agreeing to it upfront. Trust is earned by working together on hard problems and sharing the gory and the glory that results.

### The necessary role of *Conflict and Disagreement*
Disagreement is where all personal growth begins. Sometimes disagreement will bleed into conflict and that too is ok, but only if it is acknowledged. When I lead teams, we agree first on how we identify and resolve conflict. Teams can set the standard, or I will.

### How do I measure the success of our teams

A couple of years ago, I found myself leading a squad of 12 people. This team before I had joined was so focused on the good feelings and conflict free discussions, that they had lost all sight of the work they had been asked to do. My boss found it ironic that my first reaction to "The Team of Happy" - as had called it - was anything but happy. I noted after a couple of days listening that there were going to be a few moments of uncomfortable conflict and that the happiness indicator was going to be replaced with a conflict count. Further, every day for 11 days, I invited someone that the team had let down either through planning or product missteps to a "fail session" with the team. The fastest (if not best) way to yank a team out of complacency is to show them how they are perceived by their stakeholders.

I mention the happiness indicator because I have had two scrum masters at two distinct times insist that happiness is the only important measure of teamwork. We did not last long together. I despise it as a measure of team success.

All the good juju and kumbaya in the world won't save us if you aren't contributing to the learning and productivity of yourself, your colleagues, and this company. Happy - IMHO - is not an acceptable byproduct of failure to live up to expectations.

Instead, make reasonable promises about useful things to people who care. Second, deliver on that promise on time. *Rinse and repeat.*

### Standards

1. are written
2. are used
3. are changed occasionally

I've seen only one team that was so good and so isolated in their work that they could get away with having little written record of the standards they used. However, this team failed to accelerate their work with more engineering power - both excellent and proven engineers. Why? Each of these team noobs had asked to be moved because the team's ways of working (WOW) was completely inscrutable. It is impossible for someone to contribute when there are no communicated expectations.

That said, I have also led a team that focused so heavily on creating their standards that these documents never actually got tested before the team was disbanded.

Standards are like water - too little and we end up withered; too much and we drown.

## My indicators of inclusive culture

I have found this question on diversity and inclusiveness to be one of the most probative and actionable:

> *Do our colleagues represent the most diverse set of ideas and experiences available?*

I like to use indicators to test the ACTUAL inclusiveness of teams:

* **Fearlessness** - the degree to which individuals seek out ideas contrary to their own
* **Resilience** - the speed and ease with which conflict is mitigated or resolved and doesn't return in the same form (disagree, commit, forget)
* **Empathy** - your willingness to argue on behalf of someone else. I have a practical example for our engineers - empathy means having concise, well tested pull-requests. My counterexample [having no empathy] might be asking engineers to approve a 3.3k line masterpiece!)
* Conflicts are addressed directly with reference to first principles with each participant willing and able to articulate positions and beliefs
* Each person is willing and able to seek and provide honest, earnest, and fair feedback
* Each individual expects more of themself than of others
* Individuals look out for each other's well-being. I've seen well-meaning colleagues use the team's documented standards to belittle a teammate.
* All understand and adhere to the [golden rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule) and are willing to be called out when failing it
* We are proud of - and **often** celebrate - our differences. We protect these differences and support the voices even when we disagree with the words


## Decision-making

I haven't always had a section on deciding. However, in the last few years, I've noticed that team decisions have a way of degrading trust or silencing voices when we default to "single option presented --> discussion --> 'does anyone disagree?'" This is a fantastic way of ensuring group-think. Engineers sometimes fall into the trap of thinking that everyone feels free to say "no". This is manifestly wrong. Cultural aspects, context, and power always play a huge role in determining who can say what, how, and when. We must give deliberate space to dissent until dissent becomes the default.

I expect you to have an opinion. If you don't have an opinion, you are not useful in the decision making process. Come prepared! If you still don't have a position, then argue for the opinion with the least amount of support.

If you can't or won't decide, I will and I will err on the side of the most arbitrary. So, be fearless (even pretend fearless). Deep breaths. Pick one. If it turns out to be wrong, then adjust - but we'll cross that bridge later. Right now, your decision IS the right one. Go prove yourself wrong!

When we have decisions that have to be made on behalf of others, we should have consensus or simply accept someone else deciding for us. On small and large teams, this means we have to have a way to decide things - or said another way - we should decide how to decide before we find ourselves arguing over something difficult,

I like to have my teams write out the "how we decide agreement" that answers:

*Primary*: who should decide?

*Secondary*: who will decide?

1. by when?
2. considering what alternatives?
3. defaulting to what in case of indecision?
4. using what information? - *to help us know when to stop gathering data or exploring for options*
5. to what end?
6. by what decision making process?
7. how will the decision be communicated and logged?

#### By what decision making process?

> "Deciding not to decide" is a perfectly good decision and one that should always be considered.

The choice of decision making method can make or break a team. A decision that must be made during stressful moments will feel rushed and arbitrary. Even when the best balance of interests is the result, a rushed decision can leave everyone feeling ignored or disrespected. For that reason, it helps to establish the ground rules for the team upfront. Some decisions are rightly made by the team lead (appointed or de facto) while others can be deferred to individuals. However, most decisions can be reasonably put to the whole team or a subset of teammates.

The starting list of methods might be:
* unanimous / consensus
* majority vote
* committee decision - a subset of people make the decision or sometimes just the recommendation
* appointee


## Communication

I will likely ask you "what do you think? knowing what you know now, what would you recommend?" I am not being kind - I want your opinion.
I expect you to ask me these same questions.

> #### *knowing where we are is fundamental to knowing where we're going.*

### Data informed
I will ask you "how do we know?" If we don't know how we know something, that suggests that we don't actually know it. We will call out our assumptions that our knowledge is based on and leave the door open to changing facts that disrupt our plans.

### Low Context Communication

I tend to lean towards low-context comms. This is to ensure that we have opportunities to rehash the things "everybody" already "knows". I find that low-context benefits dialog across large teams. You will see that I start conversations with baseline understanding of contexts and scope. I will likely ask for repetition here so that we can draw out where original understandings have changed, or to highlight clarifications.

We will start often with the phrase, "where are we?" To my mind, knowing where we are is fundamental to knowing where we will going.

## Dependencies

  Dependencies can help us build quickly, but they can create the most profound obstacles to change.
  > #### There are no *only good* or *only bad* dependencies

  **Team Dependencies**:

  When there is a dependency on another team, i expect that BOTH teams have specifically identified the choices of that dependency and how each team will manage changes and informing on change.

  Teams should be able to carry out their mission without having to coordinate outside the team. When itâ€™s not possible to avoid an organizational dependency, I expect us to actively establish processes that enable the teams to coordinate efficiently. At the same time, we must kill all unnecessary dependencies.

  **People Dependencies**

  If there is only one person on a team that is capable and/or responsible for a critical component or process, FIX THAT NOW!

  **Code dependencies - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) v. AHA (Avoid Hasty Abstractions)**

  DRY applies within a single system. In cloud architectures, DRY complicates things tremendously. Don't use the DRY principle to justify a complicated cross-system abstraction.

  **Cloud dependencies**

  For cloud based systems, copy-paste is an easier operation than both (a) abstraction and (b) dependency management. Please don't create another dependency to simply meet the DRY imperative!!! AHA dictates everything in cloud architectures.
## Innovation

  Innovation comes from inspiration and perspiration. No one has a monopoly on fresh and exciting ideas. Get to it already! Measure one thing well that demonstrates you are thinking about impact.

  When you ask me if it's alright to try a different approach, I will probably challenge you with a logic model or try to push the idea to the limits of what you've already considered. This is to see if we are ready to build or if we should keep exploring for the moment. It is not a yes or a no. That decision will likely be yours - and so will the responsibility for making that call.
## Building teams

We do more by complementing our own ideas and skills with another person's skills and ideas. Thus we need to team up to build good, sometimes big, sometimes complicated things. We won't always succeed, but that's our goal --> cohesive teams made of thriving individuals.

Teams are immutable - change one person and you got yourself a new team. Thus, when we change things up, it can take a long time for that new team to fully develop. It may feel like regression, but people require that time to adapt to the new reality.

**Sifting**: We build good teams by recruiting and nurturing for the long term - lifting. We hire individuals to contribute their own opinions and ideas and perspectives. This is a hint to keep a hold of what you know and love about yourself. The team should not change you in ways that you do not appreciate. Likewise,

When we interview, every very candidate should walk away with the following answered completely:

  1. how do we dialog?
  2. why do we build?
  3. how do we measure success?
  4. how do we decide things as a team?
  5. where might I contribute from T-zero?

**Lifting**: We nurture individuals for the long term to fit on many teams and, often, for leadership. All who are willing should try leading. This means organizing teammates, championing ideas, mentoring their colleagues, and making decisions that go beyond your comfort zone. This is our practice pitch. By now, you have liked guessed why I say "we are what we practice repeatedly."

**Shifting**: People will be shifted around. Even the best of us don't have very many expert skills. Teams always have more needs than skills available. Because of that, we look for people who are willing to explore, change, and develop expertise over time. To do this, our teams are expected to rotate roles. Sometimes the junior dev. will be asked to lead for a week or sprint. Sometimes the data scientist will try product ownership. The point is that when we understand each other's roles better, we interact better, we build better, we figure ourselves out. Sometimes, deliberately, we will find ourselves way outside our comfort zone. And our team will be there to empathize and cover.

**Gifting**: People will be gifted to other companies - sometimes their own new one. Nobody fits perfectly on all teams. There is a great team that will be better with that person. As peers and leaders, we commit to help others find and play the sport that's their speciality. This means saying goodbye. It's always possible to do so kindly.

### The language of teams

> ##### *'I and me' for inside team, 'we and us' for everyone else*


When it's just us, we have to be explicit about our own opinions and work. However, when we represent our own and team work, it's so important for fairness to use more inclusive language of "we" to describe our work. I think this captures how some of my best teams have operated.

## Biases
I am aware of many of my biases. I watch for them, but I am still subject to most. I appreciate when others also try to identify our hidden biases that cloud our judgments and capacity to learn. [See wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases) for a rather exhaustive but solid list.

I have a friend who recommended that I actually list some of my biases here. She's right of course, but I'll save this task for a less sunny sky. To be continued....
