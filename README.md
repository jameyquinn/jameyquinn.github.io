## tl;dr:

Here's how I introduce myself to companies (see [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jameyquinn/))


> Having engineered huge-scale applications, built effective teams, and conducted research in the U.S., Kenya, Egypt, Thailand, Lebanon, India, Tunisia, Kyrgyzstan, Libya, Uzbekistan, and the Netherlands, I advise and implement data strategies ...

But, this hardly captures eveything I am and have seen. Every day I learn more of how to listen, learn, and express myself. Today, for example, I played guitar instead of eating lunch. I regularly read a chapter of something fascinating before beginning my day (today: *The Tangled Tree*, David Quammen 2018.) I steal moments to play, my 2 children and I wrestle and make up stories. Every night - as my colleagues have noticed on some late calls - my partner and I read and sign to/with our lovelies.

My partner is often frustrated that I would rather build something (and have it later) than buy something (and have it now-ish). My colleagues are often frustrated that I am inconsistent between home and work.

Like a good tall tree, I require sunshine, a fresh breeze, the buzz of life around me, and water to feel happy.

I have an experimental approach ("scouting" - searching for what's real) to most things. I am willing to be the proverbial guinea pig for a crazy idea. If you're playing music I might be the first to dance and thus give others the nerve and the freedom to dance themselves. Sometimes I'll be the last one up, while I acknowledge that every person should have a chance to shine without having shadows cast.

## My job

As an engineer, architect, and leader, I expect myself to...

* Set context and communicate expected business outcomes
* Understand and - where possible - influence priorities
* Foster learning and personal growth through experience
* Ensure that decisions are made via consultations with relevant stakeholders
* Build space for free expression and fearless exploration of ideas
* Embrace confusion while striving to minimize it

## Baseline principles

In day to day life, I use a few principles that I rely on when - I will admit it - I don't know what to do.

* Exemplify empathy
* Represent others more fairly than they represent themselves
* Integrity and candour are **not** debateable.
* You are what you practice, repeatedly (thank you for this gem @colin.teele)
* I expect excellence from **myself** and then from others, I support other's opinion at all times even in disagreement. Along the way, I make mistakes. I take accountability and learn from these.

## My Management Style

Current and former colleagues have described style as either "transformational" or "visionary" depending on the context. I don't disagree with these, but I don't particularly like the labels because of the judgment they imply. "Transformational" does not capture that I challenge a lot of things in people - sometimes their patience even. I do challenge assumptions, and intent, and process because I am more confident in the people around me when I see that they too have thought about the context we operate in.

Bullet points are admittedly trite, so here are some quick phrases that I repeat to myself:

* kindness before rightness
* those who "do" get to "decide"
* don't tell me, show me
* if you want to lead, then start walking
* Management != leadership.


#### I serve You

To actually help you, I only need that you tell me what *you* need. Sometimes, all you'll need is a rubber-duck (someone to bounce an idea on). Other times, you'll need a champion - where I'll help clear a path. Sometimes, you'll need reminder of what we're doing on this lump of rock and water hurtling through the cosmos - I will do my best to reflect on how much we've done together and how much we have yet to do.

If in doubt, start like this: "Jamey, I need...." The rest we'll figure out.

#### The case for *Time and Space*
The communication patterns of individuals and teams need time to develop and can be disrupted if not left alone to grow. I build space and time for the communication channels to grow and deepen. Trust is another growable thing. I've been on the teams that stand up the first day where we all say "trust is the most important thing!" Yes, but it's not automatic and it's not even that regularly attained - certainly not by agreeing to it upfront. Trust is earned by working together on hard problems and sharing the gory and the glory that results from those efforts.

#### The necessary role of *Conflict and Disagreement*
* Disagreement is where all personal growth begins. Sometimes disagreement will bleed into conflict and that too is ok, but only if it is acknowledged. When I lead teams, we agree first on how we identify and resolve conflict. Teams can set the standard, or I will.

* (Dogfood Principle) We are our own customers. When build what we would want to use.
* Feedback is priceless. We provide and receive feedback kindly, promptly, with empathy and candour.
* Processes exist to serve us, not the other way around.
* This is my ideal: we take accountability of anything that goes right and wrong in our team, even if we’re not involved in the issue. For example, *my teammate pushed untested code that broke production. I am responsible for the conditions that permitted that and ultimately for the effect they had. I do not correct others when they point the finger at me for this breakage. Likewise, I gather the team and *

## How do I measure the success of our teams

All the good juju and kumbaya in the world won't save us if you aren't contributing to the learning and productivity of yourself, your colleagues, and this company.

## My indicators of inclusive culture

I have found this question on diversity and inclusiveness to be one of the most probative and actionable:
> **Do our colleagues represent the most diverse set of ideas and experiences available?****

I use a number of indicators for testing the ACTUAL inclusiveness of teams:

* **Fearlessness** - the degree to which individuals seek out ideas contrary to their own
* **Resilience** - the speed and ease with which conflict is mitigated or resolved and doesn't return in the same form (disagree, commit, forget)
* **Empathy** - your willingness to argue on behalf of someone else. I have a practical example for our engineers - empathy means having concise, well tested pull-requests. My counterexample [having no empathy] might be asking engineers to approve a 3.3k line masterpiece!)
* Conflicts are addressed directly with reference to first principles with each participant willing and able to articulate positions and beliefs
* Each person is willing and able to seek and provide honest, earnest, and fair feedback
* Each individual expects more of themself than of others
* Individuals look out for each other's well-being. I've seen well-meaning colleagues use the team's documented standards to belittle a teammate.
* All understand and adhere to the [golden rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule) and are willing to be called out when failing it
* Bias experience over knowledge, doing over talking
* We are proud of - and often celebrate - our differences. We protect these differences and support the voices even when we disagree with the words


### Decision-making

I haven't always had a section on deciding. However, in the last few years, I've noticed that team decisions have a way of degrading trust or silencing voices when we default to "single option presented --> discussion --> 'does anyone disagree?'" Engineers sometimes fall into the trap of thinking that everyone feels free to say "no". Group-think

I expect you to have an opinion. If you don't have an opinion, you are not useful in the decision making process. Come prepared!

When we have decisions that have to be made on behalf of others, we must have concensus or accept someone else's decision. On small teams, this means we have to have a way to decide things - or said another way - decide how to decide! However, before being confronted with the difficult decision, it's a useful exercise to have teams discuss their ideal ways of creating and acknowledging consensus.

Primary: who should decide?
Secondary: who will decide?

1. by when?
1. considering what alternatives?
2. defaulting to what in case of indecision?
3. using what information? - *to help us know when to stop gathering data or exploring for options*
4. to what end?
5. by what decision making process?
6. how will the decision be communicated and logged?

#### By what decision making process?

The choice of decision making method can make or break a team. A decision must be made during stressful moments can feel rushed and arbitrary. Even when the best balance of interests is the result, a rushed decision can leave everyone feeling ignored or disrespected. For that reason, it helps to establish the ground rules for the team upfront. Some decisions are rightly made by the team lead (appointed or de facto) while others can be deferred to individuals. However, most decisions can be reasonably put to the whole team or a subset of teammates.

The starting list of methods might be:
* unanimous / concensus
* majority vote
* committee decision - a subset of people make the decision or sometimes just the recommendation
* appointee


> "Deciding not to decide" is a perfectly good decision and one that should always be considered.

### Communication

I will likely ask you "what do you think? knowing what you know now, what would you recommend?" I am not being kind - I want your opinion.
I expect you to ask me these same questions.

#### Low Context Communication

I tend to lean towards low-context comms. This is to ensure that we have opportunities to rehash the things "everybody" already knows. I find that low-context benefits dialog across large teams. You will see that I start conversations with baseline understanding of contexts. I will likely ask for repetition here so that we can draw out where original understandings have changed, or to highlight clarifications.

We will start often with the phrase, "where are we?" To my mind, knowing where we are is fundamental to knowing where we're going.

### Dependencies

  Dependencies can help us build quickly, but they can create the most profound obstacles to change.
  > #### *There are no *only-good* or only-bad dependencies*

  **Team Dependencies**: When there is a dependency on another team, i expect that BOTH teams have specifically identified the choices of that dependency and how each team will manage changes and informing on change.

  Teams should be able to carry out their mission without having to coordinate outside the team. When it’s not possible to avoid an organizational dependency, I expect us to actively establish processes that enable the teams to coordinate efficiently. At the same time, we must kill all unnecessary dependencies.

  **People Dependencies**
  If there is only one person on a team that is capable and/or responsible for a critical component or process, FIX THAT NOW!

  **Code dependencies - DRY v. AHA**
  DRY applies within a single system. In cloud architectures, DRY complicates things tremendously. Don't use the DRY principle to justify a complicated cross-system abstraction.

  *For cloud based systems, copy-paste is an easier operation than both (a) abstraction and (b) dependency management*
  #### Innovation

  Innovation comes from inspiration and perspiration. No one has a monopoly on fresh and exciting ideas. Get to it already! Measure one thing well that demonstrates you are thinking about impact.

  When you ask me if it's alright to try a different approach, I will probably challenge you with a logic model or try to push the idea to the limits of what you've already considered. This is to see if we are ready to build or if we should keep exploring for the moment. It is not a yes or a no. That decision will likely be yours - and so will the responsibility for making that call.
## Building teams - sifting, lifting, shifting, gifting

We do more by complementing our own ideas and skills with another person's skills and ideas. Thus we need to team up to build good, sometimes big, sometimes complicated things. We won't always succeed, but that's our goal --> cohesive teams made of thriving individuals.


Teams are immutable - change one person and you got yourself a new team. Thus, when we change things up, it can take a long time for that new team to fully develop. It may feel like regression, but people require that time to adapt to the new reality.

**Sifting**: We build good teams by recruiting and nurturing for the long term - lifting.

When we interview, every very candidate should walk away with the following answered completely:

  1. how do we dialog?
  2. why do we build?
  3. how do we measure success?
  4. how do we decide things as a team?
  5. where might I contribute from T-zero?

**Lifting**: We nurture individuals for the long term to fit on many teams and, often, for leadership. We want to have everyone who is willing try leading. This means organizing teammates, championing ideas, mentoring their colleagues, and making decisions that go beyond your comfort zone.

**Shifting**: People will be shifted around. Even ancient nerds don't have very many expert skills. Teams always have more skill needs than skills available. We look for people who are willing to explore, change, and develop expertise. To do this, our teams are expected to rotate skills. Sometimes the junior dev. will be asked to lead for a week or sprint. Sometimes the data scientist will try product ownership. The point is that when we understand each other's roles better, we interact better, we build better, we figure ourselves out.

**Gifting**: People will be gifted to other companies - sometimes their own new one. Nobody fits perfectly on all teams. There is a great team that will be better with that person. As peers and leaders, we commit to help others find and play the sport that's their speciality. This means saying goodbye. It's always possible to do so kindly.
